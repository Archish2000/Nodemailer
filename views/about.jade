		p If there's a business that knows how to speak their customers' language, it's Centaur Guitar. This rock and roll shop opens their About Us page with the bold statement, "Different. Just like You," and delivers on that promise. From recounting the founders' days playing midnight rock shows, to calling out their guitar megastore competitors, the content on and tone of this page is down-to-earth, no frills and no-nonsense, just like their business.
